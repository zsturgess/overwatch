# Overwatch

Overwatch is an extensible PHP monitoring system built on top of the excellent [Symfony Framework](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard), with a frontend interface engineered in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

Overwatch is a creation of Zac Sturgess. See also the [list of contributors](https://github.com/zsturgess/overwatch/graphs/contributors).

**Warning:** Overwatch is still in the process of being developed, and is unstable. Also, some of the code was written at 3am and needs a complete overhaul. You have been warned.
